- Calculates the **sum** of all elements.
- Computes the **average** of the numbers.
- Finds the **minimum** and **maximum** values in the array.
- Counts the number of **even** and **odd** numbers.
- Prints the array in **reverse order**.

## How to Use
1. Run the program.
2. Enter the number of elements (`N`).
3. Input the `N` integer numbers.
4. The program will output the sum, average, minimum, maximum, counts of even and odd numbers, and display the array in reverse.
